It also looks for the box named `print` (which contains the function that allows us to display things on the screen).\n",

These variables can be referred to *inside the function* by using their names -- for example, we are able to `print(inside)` on line 7. Any code which is also part of the function definition can access this namespace. At this point in the code (here, lines 4-7), we are in the **local scope**.\n",
